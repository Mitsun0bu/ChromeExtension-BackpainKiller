/       TEST PHASE       / 
/ ********************** /

1) Open Google Chrome and type "chrome://extensions" in the address bar. This will open the extensions page.

2) Turn on the "Developer mode" toggle switch in the top right corner of the page. This will enable the ability to load unpacked extensions.

3) Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder where you have saved your extension files (manifest.json, background.js, popup.html, popup.js). This will install the extension and make it available in your browser.

4) Once the extension is loaded, you should see it in the list of extensions on the chrome://extensions page, and you should also see the extension icon (for example a button) in the chrome toolbar.

5) Click on the extension icon to open the popup, then you can test the different options of your extension:

    - Test the start/stop button
    - Test the interval input to set the interval between the message

In case of errors or issues, check the browser's console for any error messages by right-clicking anywhere on the page and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element". This will open the developer tools, where the console is accessible.
